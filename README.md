# Admin Access

To access the admin features of the application, you need to set the `is_admin` column to `1` for a user account in the database. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Access the Database:**
   - Use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or a similar tool to access your database.

2. **Update the `is_admin` Column:**
   - Locate the `users` table.
   - Find the user account you want to give admin access to.
   - Change the `is_admin` column value from `0` to `1` for that user.

Example SQL query:  UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
